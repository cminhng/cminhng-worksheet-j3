1) Polymorphism is when a variable that is declared something at compile time can take on different compatible types at run time. For example, the toString method
2) Because u is a polymorphic variable, when ```u.toString()``` is called, it is viable for multiple types of Objects at run time. This is because an Object, the parent class for all the types.  It will look at the inheritance heirarchy and decide which ```toString()``` to call. "dynamically bound at run time"
3) The printed output will be ```A```. The ```toString()``` method called belongs to the parent class A.
4) The printed output for ```letterB.toString()``` is ```~~B~~```. (Since at runtime, it's of type B so it will call its own ```fancytoString()```.) crap i missed the second one
5) ```A``` because class B does not have a toString() that overrides its parent class toString(). Then ```A```.
6) will not compile bc get_name() is declared private in Class A and the abstract class requires it to be protected.
7) should print 1?? but itsnt it swapped like get alphabet is public to protected
8) ```foo1: B + B``` since A is casted to type A (unecessarily); the call to foo should consider both params as belonging to class A; since a letterA object cannot be considered a child letterB object without casting. still, since A was originally a B object, its toString() will return B. 
9) toString of fluffy: Name: fluffy \n Species: (call to breeds toString) pomeranian dog (breed)
Name: george species: dog
Name: brutus Species: (i think it calls breeds toString)
10) 
a1 will compile. everyone has is descended from a and therfore has a foo (and a bar)
a2 will compile
a3 will only compile if a is class B or C
b1 in order for mysteryB to compile, has to return b object or child object of B. no child object, so it has to be a b object
b2 calls bar of parent a bc its the only one with a bar
b3 will call b's baz
d1
d2
d3
11) you can never call the abstract class' constrcutor directly. you can only call super. and you can have abstract methods
12) make/model, tires, color, steering wheel
