1) Polymorphism is when a variable that is declared something at compile time can take on different compatible types at run time. The ```toString()``` method of an Object returns the memory address as a String. But ```toString()``` can also be called on a child of Object, and results vary based on if/how the toString method has been overwritten. ```Character.toString()``` for example, returns a String representation of a char. 
2) Because u is a polymorphic variable, when ```u.toString()``` is called, it is viable for multiple types of Objects at run time. This is because Object is the parent class for all the types. To know which ```toString()``` to call, it will look at the inheritance heirarchy.
3) The printed output will be ```A```. The ```toString()``` method called belongs to the parent class A.
4) The printed output is 
```~~B~~```
```~~B~~```
(At runtime, both objects are of type B so it will call the ```fancytoString()``` in Class B.)
5) The printed output is
```A```
```A```
because class B does not have a ```toString()``` that overrides its parent class A's ```toString()```. 
6) The program will not compile bc get_name() is declared private in Class A while the abstract class requires it to be protected.
7) The output is 
```A: 1```
8) The output is
```foo1: B + B```.
The call to ```foo()``` should consider both params as belonging to class A; so foo1 will be called. At run time, both obejcts are of type B, so ```toString()``` calls both return B. 
9) The output is
```
Name: Fluffy 
Species: Canis Familaris (pomeranian)
Name: George 
Species: Canis Familaris
Name: Brutus
Species: Felis Catus (shorthair)
```
11) 
A.1 - will compile no matter what type ```a``` is. All the types are descended from Type A and therefore have access to the foo() method. foo() will return 42 unless a is of type B, in which case foo will return 41.

A.2 - will compile because all types have access to class A's bar() method. bar() will return 50 unless a is of types: B which returns 49; D which returns 7; and E which returns 62. 

A.3 - will only compile if a is a child of class B or C, because only those classes and their descendants have access to baz() methods. B has no children but C has children B and E. 

B.1 - in order for these to compile, the b object must be of class B or a child of B. Since B has no children, b must be of type B. calls foo() inside class B and Returns 41.

B.2 - calls the bar() method belonging to parent class A bc it is the only accessible bar() method from class B. Returns 49.

B.3 - calls the baz() method belonging to B. Returns "y".

D.1 - in order for these to compile, the d object must be of class D or a child of D. Since D has no children, d must be of type D. Calls foo() in parent class A. Returns 42. 

D.2 - calls bar() method in class D. Returns 7. 

D.3 - will not compile because objects of type D do not have access to any baz() method.

12) The difference between an abstract and a regular class is that you can never call the abstract class' constructor directly (you can via ```super()```) and you can have abstract methods that aren't defined in the abstract parent class, but in the child classes. You'd want to have abstract classes when you're trying to define a class that has multiple children, but all those children have certain traits. It saves time having to define the same traits across different child classes, and also ensures all child classes meet the necessary requirements to be a descendant (abstract methods force you to define them in the child classes). 
13) Abstract class: tires, color, steering wheel (things that all cars should have)
Implemented classes: make/model, features such as sunroof, keyless entry, etc. (things that not ALL cars share).
